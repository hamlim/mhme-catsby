# Summer 2018 Trip ☀️

This summer I was lucky enough to be able to take off
two and a half week vacation from work and fly back
home to go to a few different places in Washington and Oregon with
my family.


## Vashon (July 4th to the 7th)

It started July 4th, I flew out of Boston at around 7am in the morning,
which means I woke up around 4am. I arrived in Seattle at 10am getting
 picked up by my parents and we immediately drove down to Vashon island
 to stay a few days at my grandparents house on Gold Beach.

One of the days we drove over to Point Robinson and the lighthouse.

We mostly relaxed the rest of the time we spent on the island,
 and then drove back home to pack for the next leg of our trip to Winthrop Washington.

## Winthrop (July 8th)

Our drive over to Winthrop was a packed day of sight seeing, hiking, and photo taking. We started
off on a drive through the scenic norther part of the North Cascades Highway loop.
We drove north of Concrete Washington to see a scenic look of Mount Baker and 
Mount Shuksan.

After that we had a on the road lunch in Newhalem, and after lunch visited 
Diablo Lake and Diablo Dam.

We capped off the day by stopping at the Diablo lake scenic overlook.

## Winthrop Day 2 (July 9th)

To start the first full day of Winthrop we drove back up to the Washington Pass
overlook where we took some amazing photos of Liberty Bell Mountain.

## The Travel Day (July 10th)

This was the day of the most amount of travel that we did for the whole trip. We
ended up driving from Winthrop Washington, over Stevens Pass, to home in Snohomish,
packed the trailer, and then drove to Brooks Memorial State Park.

## Brooks to Bend (July 11th)

After the long previous day, we were eager to get the drive down to Bend 
over with, as it was only about a 4 hour drive. We left Brooks early in the
morning and drove straight down to Sunriver where we unhitched the trailer.

Once we had unpacked the trailer, we hopped back in the truck to visit downtown
Bend for the Farmers market and some of the local shops.

We picked up some jam, kombucha and Ocean Rolls from the market, and stopped off 
at the beer garden at Bend Brewery.

We left the market and drove over to the Old Mill district where we had some salads,
flatbread, and pizza for dinner.

## Sparks Lake (July 12th)

On the 12th, we decided to head out to Sparks lake in an attempt to
evade the early weekend rush of people doing the same exact thing. 
Unfortunately the lake was already packed when we arrived, but we still
found a decent spot to set up our folding chairs and kayaks.

After spending a few hours at Sparks Lake, we packed up and drove over to
Devils Lake which is an entirely glacial melt fed lake, which makes it deep
blue and also incredibly cold!

When we got back to the campground, we flew the drone shortly to take some stunning video and pictures of the sunset.

## Biking Sunriver (July 13th)

On July 13th, we set out to bike around Sunriver. It was an 11 mile bike ride
that took 2 and a half hours. After the bike ride we went to 10 Barrel Brewing in Bend for some
much needed lunch and beers.

We spent the rest of the day driving around Bend, and same for the next day as well.

## Driving back up to Brooks Memorial (July 15th)

To be continued (possibly).
