# Summer 2018 Trip ☀️

Instead of dealing with hosting all the full res photos from my 
2018 summer trip, I decided to try and use a Google Photos album
to showcase all the photos and videos I took.


You can see the pictures here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/2DsTSNbiPsBUfWkx7.

Let me know what you think about this format!

import Post from '../../../../components/post-container.js'

export default (props) => <Post date="07/21/2018" {...props}/>
